            <p>Project Euler is a website where you can get free challenges to tackle on using programming.</p>
            <p>The code below is my answer to one of the questions in Project Euler.</p>

            </code></pre>
            <p>For this code, I made three functions to make it easier for me. In the code, I first calculated all triangular, pentagonal, and hexagonal numbers up to one hundred thousand, then used the "in" function to check if there is the same triangular number in the two lists.</p>
            <p>With this question, I learned how to check things by thinking the code in separate parts. For example, while I was writing the code I test ran it several times, but it didn't work. To solve this, I separated the code into chunks and checked each of them individually. It turned out that the hexagonal function was wrong, and once I fixed it, the code worked.</p>
            <p>In Project Euler, I tackled other questions such as number 5, 10, 31, and so on with my programming teacher outside school. This is because I think Project Euler is a good place to train my algorithms, logical thinking, and explanation skills.</p>

            <h3>Project 4: Scratch</h3>
            <p>The last project I am going to show you here is on Scratch.</p>
            <p>Here is the link:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1046515492/">Scratch Maze Maker</a> - This is a link to play the project.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>It might look too simple, but the algorithm itself is pretty good, so if I change the area of generation, I can easily make the maze larger. I tried this before, but there is a problem: because Scratch's clone limit is 300, I can't really make it bigger on Scratch.</p>
            <p>But I was still successful in making a rather fancy algorithm with Scratch.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>These codes are the highlights of this year, but still, I am proud of all the projects I made.</p>
            <p>As a young coder, I have aspirations in solving real-world problems. To accomplish this, I will continuously strive to expand my skills and build impactful projects using technologies.</p>
