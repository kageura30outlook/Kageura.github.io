        <h1>Welcome to Kageura's Coding Portfolio</h1>
        <p>Hi, I'm Kageura, a passionate coder. In this site I will lightly introduce some of the projects I have worked through 2023-2025.</p>

        <h2>Recent Projects</h2>

        <div class="project">
            <h3>Project 1: Maze Generating With Scratch</h3>
            <p>The first project I am going to show you here is on Scratch.</p>
            <p>Here is the link to the generator:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1046515492/">Scratch Maze Maker</a></li>
            </ol>
            <h4>What I Accomplished In This Project</h4>
            <p>This maze not only generates a maze but also does the following: the maze always has a start and a goal, the maze uses up all the space, the maze is always one block wide and the maze can be expanded easily by editing the variables that controls the size of the maze.</p>
            <h4>The Flow Of The Algorithm</h4>
            <p>The maze is created by moving the "check point," initially at the top left corner. The code randomly chooses a direction (up, down, left, or right) and checks if the block two spaces away is a path, out of bounds, or a wall. If it's a wall, the block becomes the new check point. This continues until the check point is "stuck", meaning it can't move in any direction. At this point, the code changes the current check point to a past check point and continues. The process ends when no more paths can be created, ensuring the maze has a start and goal, with all spaces filled. The maze is also expandable by editing the variable that controls the size of maze.</p>
            <h4>Problems I Faced</h4>
            <p>While I was writing the code, the code got very long. This happened because there were many selections with many conditions, which led to an even longer code. <p>
            <h4>How I Solved The Problem</h4>
            <p>To solve this, I used functions. By using a function, the length of the overall code got shorter, since I did not need to repeat a same block of code over and over. </p>
            <h4>What I Learnt</h4>
            <p>I learnt that using functions can simplify and shorten code, so it is easier for the author and the reader to understand the code. Functions came handy to other projects, so I am glad I learnt how to use functions in this project.</p>

            <h3>Project 2: Scraping with Python</h3>
            <p>This project involves scraping a website periodically to gather specific information and send it to my Gmail.</p>
            <h4>Code Explanation</h4>
            <p>Hereâ€™s the whole code for the project:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><a href="https://github.com/kageura30outlook/kageura30outlook-python_scraping_files">GitHub</a></li>
            </ol>
            <p>Here, I am going to show you the important codes.</p>
            <pre><code>
def job():
    url = "https://game8.jp/splatoon3/480736#hl_9"            
    res = urllib.request.urlopen(url)            
    soup = BeautifulSoup(res, "html.parser") 
    name = soup.find_all("td")
            </code></pre>
            <p>The code above scrapes all data that is a "td"(table data) class by using urllib.request and BeutifulSoup.</p>
            <pre><code>
if compare_files(prev_file, new_file):
    print("There are no change")
    gmail.send_test_email("There are no change")
else:
    print("There is a change")
    gmail.send_test_email("There is a change") 
            </code></pre>
            <p>The code above selects either to send a message saying "There is a change" or "There are no change".</p>
            <h4>Problems I Faced</h4>
            <p>One problem was that the data I wanted to scrape was located in a complicated place within the site, making the code challenging to scrape.</p>     
            <h4>How Solved The Problem</h4>
            <p>For this problem I wrote two steps of code to scrape the data. I did this by narrowing down the area of search, then I pulled the specific data I needed from the result.</p>
            <h4>What I Learnt</h4>
            <p>I learnt that breaking down one complex thing to 2 or more simple instructions are very useful in programming.</p>

            <h3>Project 3: Solving Project Euler Problems With Python</h3>
            <p>The last recent project I am going to show you is Project Euler</p>
            <p>Project Euler is a website where you can get free challenges to tackle on using programming.</p>
            <h4>Code Explanation</h4>
            <p>This is the link to the questions and the answers:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><a href="https://github.com/kageura30outlook/kageura30outlook-projecteuler_files">GitHub</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://projecteuler.net/archives">Project Euler</a></li>
            </ol>
            <p>Here, I am going to show you an answer to question 45.</p>            
            <p>This is the link to the question 45:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><a href="https://projecteuler.net/problem=45">Project Euler</a></li>
            </ol>
                <p>Here, I am going to show you the important codes:</p>
            <pre><code>
def tri(num1):
    answer = num1 + 1
    answer = answer * num1
    answer1 = answer/2
    return(answer1)
            </code></pre>
            <p>The code above is a function that will output a triangluar if you put "num1" as n(the "n" that is used in the question page). Similarly, I made two more functions for pentagonal numbers and hexagonal numbers.</p>
            <pre><code>
for i in range (1, 100000):
    num = num + 1
    num1 = num1 + 1
    num2 = num2 + 1
    num3 = num3 + 1
    check1.append(tri(num1))
    check2.append(pent(num2))
    check3.append(hex(num3))            
            </code></pre>
            <p>The code above will make a list of triangular, pentagonal and hexagonal, that is one hundred thousand long and n as "1". I did this because I thought there would definetly be the same numbers if I made the list 100000 items long.</p>
            <pre><code>
for r in range (1,100000):
    print(r)
    if check1[r] in check2:
        print("First found")
        if check1[r] in check3:
        print("Second found")
        print(check1[r])
        break
            </code></pre>
            <p>The code above uses the "in" function to search if there are any same numbers in the lists. Then the code will output the first number that is all a triangular, pentagonal and hexagonal.</p>
            <h4>Problems I Faced In This Question</h4>
            <p>When I runned the code initialy, it didn't work as expected: the code did not stop.</p>
            <h4>How I Solved The Problem In This Question</h4> 
            <p>To solve this problem, I divided the code into chunks and tested each set of code individually. I discovered that the hexagonal function was the source of issue, and after fixing it the code worked as expected.</p>
            <h4>What I Learnt From This Question</h4>
            <p>With this question, I learned to approach errors in codes by breaking the code into smaller chunk.</p>
            <h4>What I Learnt From This Project As A Whole</h4>
            <p>Overall, I got used to algorithms and improved on my algorithmic, logical thinking, and problem-solving skills. I also learnt other skills through this project. For examples of what I learnt are the Big O notation and dynamic programming. I am still working on the other questions from the site and I am ambtious to continue this project.</p>

        <div class="project">
            <h3>Project 4: Coding A Game With Unity</h3>
            <p>This an example of a past project. I made the game using Unity few years ago. I call it the "Blocky Platformer".</p>
            <h4>Links</h4>

            </ol>
            <h4>Problem I Faced</h4>
            <p>During the creation of the game, there was a bug that I couldn't solve: the character jumped higher than usual when touching the wall.I call this the "super jump" problems. Another promblem was that it was hard to get used to controlling the character.</p>
            <h4>How I Solved The Problem</h4>
            <p>For the "super jump" problem I made a red ceiling above the stage. By doing this when the character "super jumps", the character will hit the red ceiling and die. This will stop the character from skipping obstacles of the game using the bug. For the other problem I placed blue tutorial arrows to lead the player through the first few obstacles. By doing this, the player get used to controlling the character properly.</p>
            <h4>What I Learnt</h4>
            <p>Through this project I learnt to program from the users perspective.</p>

        <div class="conclusion">
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>The previous projects are the highlights of my work. I am also proud of my other works too.</p>
            <p>As a young coder, I have aspirations in solving real-world problems. To accomplish this, I will continuously strive to expand my skills and to build impactful projects using technologies.</p>
