        <h1>Welcome to Kageura's Coding Portfolio</h1>
        <p>Hi, I'm Kageura, a passionate coder. In this site I will lightly introduce some of the projects I have worked through 2023-2025.</p>

        <h2>Recent Projects</h2>

        <div class="project">
            <h3>Project 1: Maze Generating With Scratch</hds3>
            <p>The first project I am going to show you here is on Scratch.</p>
            <p>Here is the link:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1046515492/">Scratch Maze Maker</a> - This is a link to Scratch project that randomly generates a maze.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>What I Accomplished In This Project</h4>
            <p>This maze not only generates a maze but also does the following: the maze always has a start and a goal, the maze uses up all the space, the maze is always one block wide and the maze can be expanded easily by editing the variables that controls the size of the maze.</p>
            <h4>The Flow Of The Algorithm</h4>
            <p>The maze is created by moving the "check point," initially at the top left corner. The code randomly chooses a direction (up, down, left, or right) and checks if the block two spaces away is a path, out of bounds, or a wall. If it's a wall, the block becomes the new check point. This continues until the check point is "stuck", meaning it can't move in any direction. At this point, the code changes the current check point to a past check point and continues. The process ends when no more paths can be created, ensuring the maze has a start and goal, with all spaces filled. The maze is also expandable by editing the variable that controls the size of maze.</p>
            <h4>Problems I Faced</h4>
            <p>While I was writing the code, the code got very long. This happened because there were many selections with many conditions, which led to an even longer code. <p>
            <h4>How I Solved The Problem</h4>
            <p>To solve this, I used a function for the first time in my life. By using a function, the length of the overall code got shorter, since I didn't need to have same codes all over the place.</p>
            <h4>What I Learnt</h4>
            <p>I learnt that using functions can simplify and shorten code, so it is easier for the author and the reader to read the code. Functions came handy in other projects, so I am glad I learnt how to use it in this project.</p>

            <h3>Project 2: Scraping with Python</h3>
            <p>This project involves scraping a website periodically to gather specific information and send it to my Gmail.</p>
            <h4>Code Explanation</h4>
            <p>Hereâ€™s the whole code for the project:</p>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/kageura30outlook/kageura30outlook-python_scraping_files">GitHub</a></li>
            <p>Here, I am going to show you the important codes.</p>
            <!--<pre><code>
def compare_files(prev_file, new_file):
    if prev_file == new_file:
        return True
    else:
    return False
            </code></pre>
            <p>The code above compares the two different files which I put the scraped data in.</p>-->
            <pre><code>
def job():
    url = "https://game8.jp/splatoon3/480736#hl_9"            
    res = urllib.request.urlopen(url)            
    soup = BeautifulSoup(res, "html.parser") 
    name = soup.find_all("td")
            </code></pre>
            <p>The code above scrapes all data that is a "td"(table data) class by using urllib.request and BeutifulSoup.</p>
            <pre><code>
if compare_files(prev_file, new_file):
    print("There are no change")
    gmail.send_test_email("There are no change")
else:
    print("There is a change")
    gmail.send_test_email("There is a change") 
            </code></pre>
            <p>The code above selecets either to send a message saying "There is a change" or "There are no change".</p>
            <h4>Problems I Faced</h4>
            <p>One problem was that the data I wanted to scrape was located complicated place in the site, so it was challenging to scrape.</p>     
            <h4>How Solved The Problems</h4>
            <p>For this problem I wrote two steps of code to scrape the data. I did this by narrowing down the area of search, then I pulled the specific data I needed from the area.</p>
            <h4>What I Learnt</h4>
            <p>I learnt to break down my goal into small separated codes instead of trying to accomplish the goal by stuffing whole bunch of messy code.</p>

        <div class="project">
            <h3>Project 3: Solving Project Euler Problems With Python</h3>
            <p>The last recent project I am going to show you is Project Euler</p>
            <p>Project Euler is a website where you can get free challenges to tackle on using programming.</p>
            <h4>Code Explanation</h4>
            <p>This is the link to the questions and the answers for the questions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://github.com/kageura30outlook/kageura30outlook-projecteuler_files">GitHub</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://projecteuler.net/archives">Project Euler</a></li>
            </ul>
            <p>Here, I am going to show you a answer to question 45 in the website.</p>            
            <p>This is the link to the question 45:</p>
            <li><a href="https://projecteuler.net/problem=45">Project Euler</a></li>
            <p>Here, I am going to show you the important codes:</p>
            <pre><code>
def tri(num1):
    answer = num1 + 1
    answer = answer * num1
    answer1 = answer/2
    return(answer1)
            </code></pre>
            <p>The code above is a function that will output a triangluar if you put "num1" as n(the "n" that is used in the question page). Similarly, I made two more functions for pentagonal numbers and hexagonal numbers.</p>
            <pre><code>
for i in range (1, 100000):
    num = num + 1
    num1 = num1 + 1
    num2 = num2 + 1
    num3 = num3 + 1
    check1.append(tri(num1))
    check2.append(pent(num2))
    check3.append(hex(num3))            
            </code></pre>
            <p>The code above will make a list of triangular, pentagonal and hexagonal, that is one hundred thousand long and n as "1". I did this because I thought there would definetly be the same numbers if made the list one hundred thousand items long.</p>
            <pre><code>
for r in range (1,100000):
    print(r)
    if check1[r] in check2:
        print("First found")
        if check1[r] in check3:
        print("Second found")
        print(check1[r])
        break
            </code></pre>
            <p>The code above uses the in function to search if there is any of the same numbers in the lists. Then the code will output the first number that is all a triangular, pentagonal and hexagonal.</p>
            <h4>Problems I Faced In This Question</h4>
            <p>When I runned the code initialy, it didn't work as expected: the code kept on going and didn't stop.</p>
            <h4>How I Solved The Problem In This Question</h4> 
            <p>To solve this project, I divided the code into chunks and tested each one individually. I discovered that the hexagonal function was the issue, and after fixing it, the code worked as expected.</p>
            <h4>What I Learnt From This Question</h4>
            <p>With this question, I learned to approach errors in code by breaking the code into smaller parts.</p>
            <h4>What I Learnt From This Project As A Whole</h4>
            <p>Overall, I got used to algorithms and improved on my algorithmic, logical thinking, and problem-solving skills. I also learnt other skills through this project, just like the earlier example. Other specific examples of what I learnt are the Big O notation and dynamic programming. I am still working on the other questions in the site and I have ambtions to continue this.</p>

        <h2>Past Projects</h2>

        <div class="project">
            <h3>Project 4: Coding A Game With Unity</h3>
            <p>Tbis an example of a past project. I made the game using Unity few years ago. I call it the "Blocky Platformer".</p>
            <h4>Links</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://play.unity.com/en/games/daa2884f-5a11-44b1-8852-2b0fb21a2819/blocky-platformer">UnityPlay</a> - This is a link to play the project.</li>
                <li><a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1mSyNCH8dszb5yEEnmCqjdr9iXXWQ_ljnzRV9yR7Vj4A/edit?usp=sharing">Google Slide</a> - This is a link to a presentation for this project. Please take a look after you play the game.</li>    
            </ul>
            <h4>Problems I Faced</h4>
            <p>During the creation of the project, there was a bug that I couldn't solve: the character jumped higher than usual when the character jumps while touching the wall. Another promblem was that it was hard to get use to controling the character at the start.</p>
            <h4>How I Solved The Problems</h4>
            <p>For the "super jump" problem I made a red ceiling above the stage. By doing this when the character "super jumps", the character will hit ceiling and die. This will stop the character from skipping obstacles of the game using the bug. For the other problem I placed blue tutorial arrows to lead the player through the first few obstacles. By doing this, the player,hopefully, get how to play the game properly.</p>
            <h4>What I Learnt</h4>
            <p>Through this project I learnt to program with the users perspective, just like the previous examples.</p>

        <div class="conclusion">
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>The previous project are the highlights of this year. I am also proud of my other work too.</p>
            <p>As a young coder, I have aspirations in solving real-world problems. To accomplish this, I will continuously strive to expand my skills and to build a impactful projects using technologies.</p>
