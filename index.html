        <h1>Welcome to Kageura's Coding Portfolio</h1>
        <p>Hi, I'm Kageura, a passionate coder. In this site I will lightly introduce some of the projects I have worked on this year.</p>
    </header>

    <section id="projects">
        <h2>Projects</h2>

        <div class="project">
            <h3>Project 1: Scratch</h3>
            <p>The first project I am going to show you here is on Scratch.</p>
            <p>Here is the link:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1046515492/">Scratch Maze Maker</a> - This is a link to Scratch project that randomly generates a maze that contains a start and a goal.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Problems I Faced</h4>
            <p>I had a general idea of the project but I couldn't come up with a specific way to bring the project alive.</p>
            <h4>How I Solved The Problem</h4>
            <p> To help me solve this problem I used the internet. After looking at some sites I decided to make list of 1 and 0. I made the 1 a wall and 0 a hole. By doing this I was able to start to properly think of the algorithm and program.</p>
            <h4>What I Learnt</h4>
            <p>I learnt that it is effective to get some help from different sites to help me write a code. </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Project 1 -->
        <div class="project">
            <h3>Project 2: Blocky Platformer</h3>
            <p>This is a game I made using Unity.</p>
            <h4>Links</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://play.unity.com/en/games/daa2884f-5a11-44b1-8852-2b0fb21a2819/blocky-platformer">UnityPlay</a> - This is a link to play the project.</li>
                <li><a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1mSyNCH8dszb5yEEnmCqjdr9iXXWQ_ljnzRV9yR7Vj4A/edit?usp=sharing">Google Slide</a> - This is a link to a presentation for this project. Please take a look after you play the game.</li>    
            </ul>
            <h4>Problems I Faced</h4>
            <p>During the creation of the project, there was a bug that I couldn't solve: the character jumped higher than usual when the character jumps while touching the wall. Another promblem was that it was hard to get use to controling the character at the start.</p>
            <h4>How I Solved The Problems</h4>
            <p>For the "super jump" problem I made a red ceiling above the stage. By doing this when the character "super jumps", the character will hit ceiling and die. This will stop the character from skipping obstacles of the game using the bug. For the other problem I place blue tutorial arrows to lead the player through the first few obstacles. By doing this, the player,hopefully, get how to play the game properly.</p>
            <h4>What I Learnt</h4>
            <p>Through this project I learnt to program with the users perspective, just like the previous examples.</p>

        <div class="project">
            <h3>Project 3: Scraping with Python</h3>
            <p>This project involves scraping a website periodically to gather specific information and send it to my Gmail.</p>
            <h4>Code Explanation</h4>
            <p>Hereâ€™s the whole code for the project:</p>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/kageura30outlook/kageura30outlook-python_scraping_files">GitHub</a></li>
            <p>Here, I am going to show you the important codes.</p>
            <pre><code>
def compare_files(prev_file, new_file):
    if prev_file == new_file:
        return True
    else:
    return False
            </code></pre>
            <p>The code above compares the two different files which I put the scraped data in.</p>
            <pre><code>
def job():
    url = "https://game8.jp/splatoon3/480736#hl_9"            
    res = urllib.request.urlopen(url)            
    soup = BeautifulSoup(res, "html.parser") 
    name = soup.find_all("td")
            </code></pre>
            <p>The code above scrapes all data that is a "td"(table data) class.</p>
            <pre><code>
if compare_files(prev_file, new_file):
    print("There are no change")
    gmail.send_test_email("There are no change")
else:
    print("There is a change")
    gmail.send_test_email("There is a change") 
            </code></pre>
            <p>The code above selecets either to send a message saying "There is a change" or "There are no change".</p>
            <h4>Problems I Faced</h4>
            <p>When I started writing the code I junked everything into one file. This made it harder for me to write the code. Another problem, was that the data I wanted to search was in a complicated place so it was challenging to scrape the data.</p>     
            <h4>How Solved The Problems</h4>
            <p>To solve the problem I separated the code into separate files and linked them together with messages and variables. For the other problem I wrote two steps of code to scrape the specific data. I did this by first tightening the area of search and then scrape by using a pattern I saw in the data I want.</p>
            <h4>What I Learnt</h4>
            <p>From this project I learnt to create different jobs for different code so it is easier to turn the algorithm into code. Similarly, I learnt to take small steps to accomplish a big goal and not try to accomplish the goal with one big step.</p>

            <h3>Project 4: Project Euler</h3>
            <p>The last project I am going to show you is Project Euler</p>
            <p>Project Euler is a website where you can get free challenges to tackle on using programming.</p>
            <h4>Code Explanation</h4>
            <p>This is the link to the questions and the answers for the questions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://github.com/kageura30outlook/kageura30outlook-projecteuler_files">GitHub</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://projecteuler.net/archives">Project Euler</a></li>
            </ul>
            <p>Here, I am going to show you a answer to question 45 in the website.</p>            
            <p>This is the link to the question 45:</p>
            <li><a href="https://projecteuler.net/problem=45">Project Euler</a></li>
            <p>Here, I am going to show you the important codes:</p>
            <pre><code>
def tri(num1):
    answer = num1 + 1
    answer = answer * num1
    answer1 = answer/2
    return(answer1)
            </code></pre>
            <p>The code above is a function that will output a triangluar if you put "num1" as n(the "n" that is used in the question page). Similarly, I made two more functions for pentagonal numbers and hexagonal numbers.</p>
            <pre><code>
for i in range (1, 100000):
    num = num + 1
    num1 = num1 + 1
    num2 = num2 + 1
    num3 = num3 + 1
    check1.append(tri(num1))
    check2.append(pent(num2))
    check3.append(hex(num3))            
            </code></pre>
            <p>The code above will make a list of triangular, pentagonal and hexagonal, that is one hundred thousand long and n as "1". I did this because I thought there would definetly be the same numbers if made the list one hundred thousand items long.</p>
            <pre><code>
for r in range (1,100000):
    print(r)
    if check1[r] in check2:
        print("First found")
        if check1[r] in check3:
        print("Second found")
        print(check1[r])
        break
            </code></pre>
            <p>The code above uses the in function to search if there is any of the same numbers in the lists. Then the code will output the first number that is all a triangular, pentagonal and hexagonal.</p>
            <h4>Problems I Faced In This Question</h4>
            <p>When I runned the code initialy, it didn't work as expected: the code kept on going and didn't stop.</p>
            <h4>How I Solved The Problem In This Question</h4> 
            <p>To solve this project, I divided the code into chunks and tested each one individually. I discovered that the hexagonal function was the issue, and after fixing it, the code worked as expected.</p>
            <h4>What I Learnt From This Question</h4>
            <p>With this question, I learned to approach problems by breaking the code into smaller parts.</p>
            <h4>What I Learnt From This Project As A Whole</h4>
            <p>Overall, I got used to algorithms and improved on my algorithmic, logical thinking, and problem-solving skills. I also learnt other skills through this project, just like the earlier example. Other specific examples of what I learnt are the Big O notation and dynamic programming. I am still working on the other questions in the site and I have ambtions to continue this.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>The previous project are the highlights of this year. I am also proud of my other work too.</p>
            <p>As a young coder, I have aspirations in solving real-world problems. To accomplish this, I will continuously strive to expand my skills and to build a impactful projects using technologies.</p>
