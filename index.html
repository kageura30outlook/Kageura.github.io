        <h1>Welcome to Kageura's Coding Portfolio</h1>
        <p>Hi, I'm Kageura, a passionate coder. In this site I will lightly introduce some of the projects I have worked on this year.</p>
    </header>

    <section id="projects">
        <h2>Projects</h2>

        <!-- Project 1 -->
        <div class="project">
            <h3>Project 1: Blocky Platformer</h3>
            <p>This is a game I made using Unity.</p>
            <h4>Links</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://play.unity.com/en/games/daa2884f-5a11-44b1-8852-2b0fb21a2819/blocky-platformer">UnityPlay</a> - This is a link to play the project.</li>
                <li><a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1mSyNCH8dszb5yEEnmCqjdr9iXXWQ_ljnzRV9yR7Vj4A/edit?usp=sharing">Google Slide</a> - This is a link to a presentation for this project. Please take a look after you play the game.</li>    
            </ul>
            <h4>Problems I Faced</h4>
            <p>During the creation of the project, there was a bug that I couldn't solve: the character did a super jump when touching the wall. Another promblem was that the project was hard to play at the start.</p>
            <h4>How I Solved The Problems</h4>
            <p>For the "super jump" problem I made a red ceiling above the stage. By doing this when the character "super jumps", the character will hit ceiling and die. This will stop the character from skipping obstacles of the game using the bug. For the other problem I place blue tutorial arrows to lead the player through the first few obstacles. By doing this, the player,hopefully, get how to play the game properly.</p>
            <h4>What I Learnt</h4>
            <p>Through this project I learnt to program with the users perspective, just like the previous examples.</p>

        <!-- Project 2 -->                  
        <div class="project">
            <h3>Project 2: Scraping with Python</h3>
            <p>This project involves scraping a website periodically to gather specific information and send it to my Gmail.</p>
            <h4>Code Explanation</h4>
            <p>Here’s the whole code for the project:</p>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/kageura30outlook/kageura30outlook-python_scraping_files">GitHub</a></li>
            <p>Here, I am going to show the important codes </p>
            <pre><code>
                def compare_files(prev_file, new_file):
                    if prev_file == new_file:
                        return True
                    else:
                        return False
            </code></pre>
            <p>The code above compares the two different files which I put the scraped data in.</p>
            <pre><code>
                
                def job():

                url = "https://game8.jp/splatoon3/480736#hl_9"
            
                res = urllib.request.urlopen(url)
            
                soup = BeautifulSoup(res, "html.parser") 
                name = soup.find_all("td")
            </code></pre>
            <p>The code above scrapes all data that is a "td"(table data) class.</p>
            <pre><code>
                if compare_files(prev_file, new_file):
                print("There are no change")
                gmail.send_test_email("There are no change")
            else:
                print("There is a change")
                gmail.send_test_email("There is a change") 
            </code></pre>
            <p>The code above selecets either to send a message saying "There is a change" or "There are no change".</p>
            <h4>Problems I faced</h4>
            <p>When I started writing the code I junked everything into one file. This made it harder for me to wite the code. Another problem, was that I couldn't really think of a way to search the data in the site.</p>     
            <h4>How Solved The Problems</h4>
            <p>To solve the problem I separated the code into separtate files and funtions and linked them together with messages and variables. For the other problem I made two steps for scraping the specific data.</p>
            <h4>What I Learnt</h4>
            <p>From this project I learnt to create different jobs for different code so it is easier to turn the algorithm into code. Similarly, I learnt to take small steps to accomplish a big goal and not try to accomplish the goal with one big step.</p>

            <h3>Project 3: Project Euler</h3>
            <p>Project Euler is a website where you can get free challenges to tackle on using programming.</p>
            <p>The code below is my answer to one of the questions in Project Euler.</p>
            <p>This is the link to the questions and the code answer for the questions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://github.com/kageura30outlook/kageura30outlook-projecteuler_files">GitHub</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://projecteuler.net/archives">Project Euler</a></li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Code Explanation</h4>
            <p>This is the link to the question 45:</p>
            <li><a href="https://projecteuler.net/problem=45">Project Euler</a></li>
            <p>Here’s the code snippet of my answer for question 45:</p>
            <pre><code>
                num = 1
                answer1 = 0
                answer2 = 0
                answer3 = 0
                check1 = [285]
                check2 = [165]
                check3 = [143]
                num1 = 285
                num2 = 165
                num3 = 143
                def tri(num1):
                    answer = num1 + 1
                    answer = answer * num1
                    answer1 = answer/2
                    return(answer1)
                def pent(num2):
                    answer = num2 * 3 - 1
                    answer = answer * num2
                    answer2 = answer/2
                    return(answer2)
                def hex(num3):
                    answer = num3 * 2
                    answer = answer - 1
                    answer3 = num3 * answer
                    return(answer3)
                for i in range(1, 100000):
                    num = num + 1
                    num1 = num1 + 1
                    num2 = num2 + 1
                    num3 = num3 + 1
                    check1.append(tri(num1))
                    check2.append(pent(num2))
                    check3.append(hex(num3))
                for r in range(1,100000):
                    print(r)
                    if check1[r] in check2:
                        print("Found!")
                        if check1[r] in check3:
                            print(check1[r])
                            break    
            </code></pre>
            <p>For this code, I made three functions to make it easier for me. In the code, I first calculated all triangular, pentagonal, and hexagonal numbers up to one hundred thousand. Then used the "in" function to check if there is the same triangular number in the two lists.</p>
            <h4>What I Learnt</h4>
            <p>With this question, I learned to approach problems by breaking the code into smaller parts. For example, when I ran the code initially, it didn’t work. To resolve this, I divided the code into chunks and tested each one individually. I discovered that the hexagonal function was the issue, and after fixing it, the code worked as expected.</p>
            <p>In Project Euler, I worked on problems like number 5, 10, 31, and others with my programming teacher outside of school. I find Project Euler to be an excellent platform for improving my algorithmic, logical thinking, and problem-solving skills.</p>

        <div class="project">
            <h3>Project 4: Scratch</h3>
            <p>The last project I am going to show you here is on Scratch.</p>
            <p>Here is the link:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1046515492/">Scratch Maze Maker</a> - This is a link to play the project.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>While the algorithm may seem simple, it’s quite effective, allowing me to easily adjust the maze size by changing the generation area. I attempted this before, but encountered a limitation: Scratch has a clone limit of 300, so I can’t make the maze larger on that platform.</p>
            <p>Neverless, I was still able to create a fairly advanced algorithm using Scratch.</p>
            <h4>What I Learnt</h4>
            <p> I learnt that I need to keep my own code clean, so I understand it better later on. I also figured that commenting on my own code is also effective.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>The previous project are the highlights of this year. I am also proud of my other work too.</p>
            <p>As a young coder, I have aspirations in solving real-world problems. To accomplish this, I will continuously strive to expand my skills and to build a impactful projects using technologies.</p>
