        <h1>Welcome to My Coding Portfolio</h1>
        <p>Hi, I'm Kageura, a passionate coder. In this site I will lightly introduce some of the projects I have worked on so far.</p>

        <h2>Projects</h2>

        <!-- Project 1 -->
        <div class="project">
            <h3>Project 1: Blocky Platformer</h3>
            <p>This is a game I made using Unity.</p>
            <h4>Links</h4>
            <ul>

            <h4>What I Learnt</h4>
            <p>I earned deeper unserstanding of  c# and Unity. I also learnt how to adjust my work to make it to the right level for the user.</p>

            <h3>Project 2: Scraping with Python</h3>
            <p>This project involves scraping a website periodically to gather specific information and send it to my Gmail.</p>
            <h4>Code Explanation</h4>
            <p>Here’s the code snippets from the project:</p>

            <h4>What I Learnt</h4>

            <h3>Project 3: Project Euler</h3>
            <p>Project Euler is a website where you can get free challenges to tackle on using programming.</p>
            <p>The code below is my answer to one of the questions in Project Euler.</p>
            <p>This is the link to the question:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://projecteuler.net/problem=45">Project Euler</a></li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Code Explanation</h4>
            <p>Here’s the code snippet from the project:</p>
            <pre><code>
                num = 1
                yousei = 0
                answer1 = 0
                answer2 = 0
                answer3 = 0
                check1 = [285]
                check2 = [165]
                check3 = [143]
                num1 = 285
                num2 = 165
                num3 = 143
                def tri(num1):
                    answer = num1 + 1
                    answer = answer * num1
                    answer1 = answer/2
                    return(answer1)
                def pent(num2):

                    answer = answer * num2

                    return(answer2)
                def hex(num3):

                    return(answer3)

                    num = num + 1
                    num1 = num1 + 1
                    num2 = num2 + 1
                    num3 = num3 + 1

                    check3.append(hex(num3))
                for r in range(1,100000):
                    print(r)
                    if check1[r] in check2:
                        print("Rinn")
                        if check1[r] in check3:
                            print(check1[r])
                            break    
            </code></pre>
            <p>For this code, I made three functions to make it easier for me. In the code, I first calculated all triangular, pentagonal, and hexagonal numbers up to one hundred thousand, then used the "in" function to check if there is the same triangular number in the two lists.</p>
            <h4>What I Learnt</h4>
            <p>With this question, I learned to approach problems by breaking the code into smaller parts. For example, when I ran the code initially, it didn’t work. To resolve this, I divided the code into chunks and tested each one individually. I discovered that the hexagonal function was the issue, and after fixing it, the code worked as expected.</p>
            <p>In Project Euler, I worked on problems like number 5, 10, 31, and others with my programming teacher outside of school. I find Project Euler to be an excellent platform for improving my algorithmic, logical thinking, and problem-solving skills.</p>

        <div class="project">
            <h3>Project 4: Scratch</h3>
            <p>The last project I am going to show you here is on Scratch.</p>
            <p>Here is the link:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1046515492/">Scratch Maze Maker</a> - This is a link to play the project.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>While the algorithm may seem simple, it’s quite effective, allowing me to easily adjust the maze size by changing the generation area. I attempted this before, but encountered a limitation: Scratch has a clone limit of 300, so I can’t make the maze larger on that platform.</p>
            <p>Despite the limitations, I was still able to create a fairly advanced algorithm using Scratch.</p>
            <h4>What I Learnt</h4>
            <p> I learnt that I need to keep my own code clean, so I understand it better later on. I also figured that commenting on my own code is also effective.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>The previous project are the highlights of this year. I am also proud of my other work too.</p>
            <p>As a young coder, I have aspirations in solving real-world problems. To accomplish this, I will continuously strive to expand my skills and build impactful projects using technologies.</p>
